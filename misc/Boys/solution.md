## Write-Up

The description of the challenge leads us to check the github account of a person who goes by the name `sk1nnywh1t3k1d`, after doing that, we can find only one repo of a `chat-app` application.

When seeing closer, we can see two commits are done for this app, where on of them contained a `chat.txt` and has been deleted in the next commit. Hre is the content of the file :

```
Server: bit.ly/voughtencrypted
Client: Billy
```

The link leads us to a `mp3` file that contains a discussion named `secret_message.wav` of a named `Billy` with another person. After Decoding it, here is what we get this link :

```
bit.ly/endvought
```

this link contains an image that the order for its blocks is scrambled (check `7_tower.png`).

After unscramble it, we got the following adress : `HUGHIECAMPBELL392@GMAIL.COM`
